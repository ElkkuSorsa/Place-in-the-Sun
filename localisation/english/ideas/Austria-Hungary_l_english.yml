  austria_hungary.1.d:0 "Austrian Empire and now Austria-Hungary had always been a melting pot of many cultures and nationalities with different traditions. Thanks to 1849 Ausgleich many of these issues are not problem of the Kaiserhaus but each regionals kingdoms, even then our leadership is not as safe as many would think. With now each region and kingdom having some of it's own governing power they used it not in so well meant manner, the Czech parliament keeps trying to slow down reforms or even block them as a whole, while for example Croatians are much happier to be more and more dependent on our leadership than the on Hungarian one. The same way as are Poles and Ruthenians thanks to which we for now know that Galicia should be safe but still not as safe as we thought, all of this needs to be dealt with as soon as possible until the Hungarians or other mayor powers decide we are too weak to resist, get few ideas to the Kaiser himself, we need to act.

Russian aristorcracy used to comunicate in French while the peasentry in their informal form of Russian, the same applies for us. Many people in our nation communicate in a variety of languages and style, it is and must be very important for us to give these poor and not so able people at least some form of lingual eduction so for example men can later become officers and women better mothers and get our nation to be the scientific capital of europe as it used to be, even if it will take some time, we are prepared to accept what it takes to finally get some of that vitory."

  austria_hungary.3.d:0 "Transleithania was always very multiculturial the same way as Cislethania. A huge difference between our view of multiculturalism and ethnicity can be seen the first moment one arrives to Felvídek or Erdély where Romanian or Slovak peasents are subjagated to very systematical 'Magyarization' thanks to which many culturual traditions of other groups of people start to slowly fade out, especially in regions of Felvídek where the Hungarian process of Hungarinisation had been going according to their plan, that couldn't be said about the same program in Erdély where many Romanians still live and resist magyarization as much as they can. Of course many of these groups that resist are not then allowed to be as educated as their hungerian counterparts and so the graphs showing that Erdély Romanians living in high mountains are the most iliterate, many people had already whispered in to our Kaisers ear about the situtation being the Danube but for the sake of not damaging our relations with the leadership of Hungary, our Kaiser decided to not intervene, even if he would like to.

  austria_hungary.4.d:0 "It was a day like all the other in the mainly German speaking city of Brünn or in Czech, Brno. Average working man would not stop not only for a second to take some time off as their boss could be somewhere and could have seen them, or maybe Evidenzbureau agents are maybe roaming around and then them could report them to their boss or lord. One those man was also Josef or Pepa, how he was called in his Czech hometown and family. It was today that Pepa who had been a student for a long period of his life finally has a chance to get his so much wanted license for woodcrafting and open his own little shop in Židenice. Thanks to so many new regulations beeing loosen he can finally speak with the clerk in his mothertoung, so in Czech. When he comes to the clerks window he sees a old looking man with a grown moustache and starts to talk to him in Czech, the clerk looks with a weird smirk on him and then yells something in German on his other cooworkers and leaves. In a second another a bit younger clerk arrives and askes Pepa what he needs here, and so Pepa only smiles at him and slowly spells out his name, a bit later on Pepa leaves with his license, maybe happines in this world exists, sometimes."

Today, the tide has turned and with the coup and purge of todays leading dynasty in Beograd, we can only spectate hell unleash in our southern neighbour.

 pathguide.2.d:0 "Federalism/Trialism: \nIn the army question crisis, deny the compromise, but don't double down and abdicate. Then select the right successor. Or you could just wait like historically for the correct character to take over. \n\nRepublic/Fascism/Austrian Empire: \nWhen appointing Hungarian prime minister, make sure that F48P wins, but refuse appointment. Or you could also make Hungary rebel in the Army question crisis/getting trust to 0. When they rebel, you must lose to get the republic/fascism and to end the dual rule, you must win. You will get new focus trees."
